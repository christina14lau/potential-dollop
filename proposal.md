# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Things you need to hear" or TYNTH

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Discord bot that would provide a daily quote. The daily quote would include positivity quotes or even life advice.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

For the bot to work, we would need to have a discord server for the bot to be invited to. It should be executed through a channel. If we were to prompt it with a command that would be listed, it would send back a quote and possibly a gif.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I believe I would at least be able to make it so that the discord bot would be able to join a server.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I believe a better outcome for this project would be that the bot is able to send a quote AND a gif. Although, I think that I can get the quotes to work.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my final project would be that everything works. I hope to accomplish that feat.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For my project, I think I would have to start off with finding a list of quotes and place them in a text file, along with gif links. I believe that I would have to set up a Discord API and I would also be using Python along with it. I will be working on this by myself.
