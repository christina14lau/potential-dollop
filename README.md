## TYNTH
This is a Discord bot that sends out motivational quotes through command ```-```.
To get this bot to work, only ```-quote``` or ```-gif``` works.

## THINGS I STRUGGLED WITH
1. Couldn’t get pip to work when trying to add the discord module with the console. Took the longest…
2. Main code wasn’t reading my quotes text file.
3. Once it started to actually read, it would post the same quote over and over again.
4. Originally, I downloaded individual images for the bot to post as gifs but it took too long to download the ones I’ve selected.
5. Realized that when sending a message on discord, the links would become actual gif images.
6. Ended up having to copy and paste links into a gif text file.

## WEBSITES THAT HELPED :)
1. ```https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html```  -  this website helped me get started on how to even connect the bot at the very beginning. Definitely worth reading.
2. ```https://realpython.com/what-is-pip/```  -  this website helped me understand pip more. I definitely wouldn't even get past the beginning without it...

### Overall...
I honestly really enjoyed looking through the websites I listed above, and honestly, it makes me want to improve the bot even more. I want to try to get it to at least play music in voice calls now. So I think I'm going to work on that over summer break.
