Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I've been able to create my own discord bot, been able to go online and respond to certain commands.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I've yet to be able to make the bot read a list of quotes off a text file. 

(UPDATE 4/18)
Still trying to have it read off a text file.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

At the beginning, it was quite confusing how to even import discord since I have to install it first. Another problem was trying to get pip to work. I had to go through my system environment variables.
